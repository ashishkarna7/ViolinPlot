# ViolinPlot
A violin plot is a data visualization tool that combines a box plot with a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plot to show the distribution of numerical data. The KDE component is what gives the violin plot its characteristic "violin" shape, providing a smooth estimate of the dataâ€™s probability density.
It is built as a SDK in Swift with MVVM design pattern adhering to SOLID design principles.
